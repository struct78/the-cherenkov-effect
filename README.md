# The Cherenkov Effect

The Cherenkov Effect is project that is a project that aims to capture the nuclear anxiety of the 1980s through a combination of generative music and performance art. A performer wields various radioactive materials in the vicinity of numerous Geiger counters and Arduino micro-controllers. The radiation levels drive pitch and note length of each instrument, creating tension and evoking the feelings of fear and dread familiar to those who lived through the Cold War.

Each track takes its name and inspiration from a nuclear facility — civilian or military — somewhere in the world. Our debut track, APS-1 Obninsk, takes its name from the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity commercially in Russia.
